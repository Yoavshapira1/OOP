=============================
simply as described in the excercise instructions: A clacc for each object.
The Library object uses the Book and Patron objects.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
* Giving ID numbers - since every Library object is stand alone, the IDs are the libarary's quality. Meanly, the library object gives the ID. Easiest way - ordered number in the array, meanly: indices.
* Keeping the information: "how many books each patron borrows at the moment" for each patron. Since a Patron can be, theoretically, registered to more than 1 library, thie is a Library's member. I kept this in an array, in same size oe Patron array.
